  intro: `I'm <strong>Misha Reyes</strong>, a software engineer and experienced graphic designer. 
  I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Arts degree in Computer Science at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver. 
  I was born and raised in Manila, Philippines.`,
  aboutMeInfo: `One thing you could hear me talking non-stop about are all my <b>favorite TV shows</b>: Brooklyn Nine-Nine, Avatar: The Last Airbender, 
  Star Wars: Clone Wars, Adventure Time, Young Justice, The Good Place, How I Met Your Mother, Sherlock, Loki, Andor, and many, many more. At any given moment, Iâ€™m probably in the middle of 
  binging a brand new series or rewatching a classic. <br><br> While I watch my shows, Iâ€™m usually (sometimes even simultaneously :>) <b>designing or coding, or both</b>! These are the three things that I find I can do almost endlessly: 
  trying to puzzle through an episodeâ€™s cliffhanger, a design challenge, or yet another bug in my code. <br><br> In my spare time, I also love singing with my ukulele, scuba diving, badminton,
  teaching computer science as a <b><i><a href="https://ubccsss.org/services/courses/cpsc-213/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CPSC 213</a></i> TA at UBC</b>,  wakeboarding, cooking & eating Filipino food (ily Jollibee!), advocating for <b>gender equality in tech</b>, and learning about <b>UX/UI or blockchain</b>.`,

    `I worked as a <b>Design Intern for Brew Lab</b> from 2020 to 2021. I managed social media marketing post scheduling and creation, 
  designing around 2-3 graphic posts per week. With consistent engagement and effective information design, our marketing strategies contributed to an orders-per-month increase of 88%. 
  I joined the team when a solid brand was already established, so the challenge for me was to take the existing aesthetic, spin it into something that fits my personal style, 
  and also make it versatile enough to produce multiple posts in a short amount of time.`,
    `My very first project was to design an <b>infographic of the beer-brewing process</b> featuring some of Brew Lab's original beginner kits. 
  The challenge here was depicting that there was a specific process/flow to follow, with some steps even being repeated. Using the <b>carousel feature of Instagram</b>, 
  I used <b>large arrows</b> to communicate to the user to scroll to the next slide for more information. On the instruction that repeats a step (Step 06 -> Step 02),
  there is also a smaller but still noticeable <b>arrow below that doubles back</b> past multiple slides to a previous step for the user's ease of navigation.
  Overall, I'm proudest of this design as it delivers a lot of information to the user, but also smoothly guides them through it in a fashion that highlights Brew Lab's brand.`,
    `Below are some of the <b>other posts I designed</b> throughout the year depending on the specific events and sales strategies that our team decided upon. 
  We would hold special promotions for holidays such as Valentine's Day, Father's Day, or Christmas. We would also have giveaways to promote new flavors or items in our store.
  <b>Graphic text-based posts</b> such as these would be interwoven with professional studio images of our products on our social media pages, 
  in order to create a feed that does not overwhelm with text, but engages the user with varied content.`,
    `And that concludes my work with Brew Lab! It was a truly enjoyable experience working with the tight-knit team; their constant support and 
  constructive criticism allowed me to really <b>grow as a designer and marketing strategist</b>. They also gave me sneak peeks into the operations and web development 
  side of things just so I could learn more about the business overall. They also allowed me a lot of freedom and independence with the role, 
  so I got to play a big part in <b>shaping today's public image</b> of Brew Lab.`,
