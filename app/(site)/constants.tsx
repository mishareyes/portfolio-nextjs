    `I worked as a <b>Design Intern for Brew Lab</b> from 2020 to 2021. I managed social media marketing post scheduling and creation, 
  designing around 2-3 graphic posts per week. With consistent engagement and effective information design, our marketing strategies contributed to an orders-per-month increase of 88%. 
  I joined the team when a solid brand was already established, so the challenge for me was to take the existing aesthetic, spin it into something that fits my personal style, 
  and also make it versatile enough to produce multiple posts in a short amount of time.`,
    `My very first project was to design an <b>infographic of the beer-brewing process</b> featuring some of Brew Lab's original beginner kits. 
  The challenge here was depicting that there was a specific process/flow to follow, with some steps even being repeated. Using the <b>carousel feature of Instagram</b>, 
  I used <b>large arrows</b> to communicate to the user to scroll to the next slide for more information. On the instruction that repeats a step (Step 06 -> Step 02),
  there is also a smaller but still noticeable <b>arrow below that doubles back</b> past multiple slides to a previous step for the user's ease of navigation.
  Overall, I'm proudest of this design as it delivers a lot of information to the user, but also smoothly guides them through it in a fashion that highlights Brew Lab's brand.`,
    `Below are some of the <b>other posts I designed</b> throughout the year depending on the specific events and sales strategies that our team decided upon. 
  We would hold special promotions for holidays such as Valentine's Day, Father's Day, or Christmas. We would also have giveaways to promote new flavors or items in our store.
  <b>Graphic text-based posts</b> such as these would be interwoven with professional studio images of our products on our social media pages, 
  in order to create a feed that does not overwhelm with text, but engages the user with varied content.`,
    `And that concludes my work with Brew Lab! It was a truly enjoyable experience working with the tight-knit team; their constant support and 
  constructive criticism allowed me to really <b>grow as a designer and marketing strategist</b>. They also gave me sneak peeks into the operations and web development 
  side of things just so I could learn more about the business overall. They also allowed me a lot of freedom and independence with the role, 
  so I got to play a big part in <b>shaping today's public image</b> of Brew Lab.`,

    `I worked as a <b>Product Designer for Consensus: the social card game where majority rules!</b> from 2019 to 2020. 
    There had already been a previous design for the product, but I was given full creative freedom to establish a <b>brand new product branding and design</b> from scratch. 
    With my help, Consensus was over 250% funded within less than a day of our launch. As of today, there are a total of 158 backers and $5000+ pledged for the product on Kickstarter.`,
    `To set off on my task of establishing our new brand, I began with a <b>color scheme that revolves around blue</b>: the color that represents openness, depth, trust, loyalty, and sincerity. 
    With how the game promotes socializing and opening up to your friends/family, blue's meanings would help foster important values. 
    Next, I worked on a logo for Consensus. Most notably, the <b>"O" has a target bullseye</b>, which is in line with how part of the game is to point at people. 
    We envisioned our brand to come off as <b>welcoming and playful</b>, as it is indeed a social card game. 
    To accomplish this, we used a sans-serif font and integrated a simple colorful "confetti" embellishment on graphics (tiny triangles, circles, squares).`,
    `Below are some of the <b>other graphics I designed</b> to populate our Kickstarter campaign. 
    These posters communicated a large range of messages, such as: budget, production timeline, testimonials, reward tiers, point systems, and stretch goals. 
    Overall, the challenge was to <b>draw as many people into the product</b> within the quickest amount of time by communicating large amounts of information as efficiently as possible. 
    With how we accomplished our funding goal within less than a day of our launch, I'd like to think that we overcame this goal with overwhelming success!`,
    `And that concludes my work with Consensus! It was my <b>first time having full creative freedom</b> over a product, 
    especially as I worked as the sole designer. I learned so much from this experience and, after the initial learning curve of establishing a branding from scratch, 
    really enjoyed expanding the designs and <b>learning to be more dynamic</b> with my style. This flexibility was illustrated when we introduced NSFW and Silicon Valley expansion packs into the game, 
    with yellow and red accents now entering the usual blue color schemes. All these opportunities gave me the chance to <b>experiment and grow</b> a lot,

    `Fresh out of high school, my friends and I co-founded an initiative called <b>Hayag Pilipinas</b> in July of 2020. 
    We were inspired to do so because we witnessed how much our fellow Filipinos were struggling, 
    especially with the onslaught of the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, we established a platform that bridges impoverished 
    Filipino communities and those who wish to help. Since then, we have raised PhP48,900+ to provide <b>27,800 sanitary napkins</b>
    for the inmates of the Correctional Institute for Women in Mandaluyong, Philippines. 
    We have also raised PhP350,000+ to provide <b>tablets to 100+ scholars</b> who were previously unable to attend classes due to the transition to online learning. 
    We also raised PhP1.5+ million to help rebuild the <b>typhoon-stricken communities</b> of Bicol after Typhoons Quinta, Rolly, and Ulysses.`,
    `My particular role in Hayag was as a designer, where I helped design 15+ publication materials posted on social media. 
    Employing techniques for <b>information design</b>, it was an interesting challenge to frame loads of information in a way 
    that both entices and educates. A design of mine that I'd like to feature is <b>our initiative's logo</b>. 
    I went through many, many drafts and versions (as detailed below ;P) before we all agreed on the logo design we have now – <b>a letter 'H' with a bridge in the middle</b>. 
    This design incorporates our goal of 'bridging communities' seamlessly with our initiative name. 
    Additionally, the names of our individual projects – pula, lila, kahel – are all <b>Filipino words of colors</b> (red, violet, orange). 
    To signal a change in our projects, we <b>change the color of our logo</b> along with the color schemes of the graphic posts on our social media.`,
    `Below are some of the <b>other graphics I designed</b> to be posted on our social media. You can see here our <b>varying color schemes of red, violet, and orange</b>, 
    which each belong to their corresponding project. Our main platform of reach was on Instagram, so we often leveraged the <b>story and carousel features</b> of posts. 
    We would try to catch the viewer's attention with a dynamic and bright cover photo, enticing them to scroll to the next slide, 
    which contains a bigger bulk of the post's information.`,
    `And that concludes my work with Hayag Pilipinas! This project means a lot to me as it was the first time any of my graphic designs had a 
    <b>real, lasting impact on people's lives</b>. With every efficiently-designed post, 
    we attracted more people who wanted to help, thus raising more money for Filipinos in need.`,

    `CONGRATS! You've uncovered a <b>hidden page</b> 😲😲😲`,
    `This website you're on right now is a special project of mine. I have <b>personally designed, prototyped, and coded this entire website from scratch</b> over the Summer of 2022, and again in the Summer of 2024. 
    Rather than using a website management platform like WordPress, Webflow, or Wix, I decided to code the website myself. 
    This decision was partly to gain extra practice with my frontend coding skills, but also to avoid being constrained by the templates these platforms offer. 
    Coding it myself allowed me to be <b>as flexible as I wanted</b> with the design and to add a personal touch to the final product. 
    Below, I outline each step of the design and coding process that I went through to create this website.`,
    `The website you see right now is <b>bursting with my personality</b>! I used four of my <b>favorite colors</b> – blue, peach, purple, and turquoise – and incorporated them into colorful and bright gradients. 
    For text, I stuck to a solid black color to ensure great contrast with the bright colors, making it perfect for readability on screens. 
    I chose <b>Inter as the body font</b> because it's a good basic serif font that also helps with readability. 
    It's more rounded than fonts like Avenir or Lato, matching the overall aesthetic of my website. 
    For the header font, I wanted something significant to me, so I chose Maragsâ, a font created by <b>Filipino artist</b> <i><a href="https://www.instagram.com/jad.otf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John David Maza</a></i>. 
    It boasts Filipino type styles with tapered tips and flowing strokes, mimicking Filipino accent marks.`,
    `For the overall design aesthetic, I went for <b>fun gradient blobs</b> in the backgrounds of my pages. 
    This trend, especially popular in website and UI design, uses more rounded shapes rather than flat edges. 
    I find this allows for a more interesting flow and adds a playful aspect, which reflects my personality! 
    I also incorporated <b>interactive animations</b> on every page to keep visitors entertained (which, in fact, is how you found this hidden page in the first place!). 
    Adding a <b>solid black outline</b> around most of the shapes and buttons helps keep the design grounded and matches well with the black-colored text.`,
    `Friends and family who have seen this website have all said how well it encapsulates me as a person, and I'm very proud of that fact. 
    It has been a true pleasure working on this website, and I'm so glad you're here to see it now!`,
    `I started by mapping out a prototype first on paper, then on <b>Figma</b>. 
    The images below demonstrate my <b>paper prototype -> low-fidelity wireframe -> high-fidelity mockup process</b>. 
    I found it easier to stick to a neutral color scheme in the initial planning stages, focusing more on building the skeleton of the website. 
    After establishing a solid foundation, I was able to focus on building a color scheme and finding pictures to place.`,
    `I used <b>vanilla HTML and CSS</b> to create my website. 
    Since I didn't need to scale it and would keep it as static pages, this was the most straightforward route. 
    It also helped me brush up on basic HTML and CSS concepts, such as flexbox and responsiveness for different device sizes. 
    I used <b>JavaScript</b> to make my <b>navigation bar sticky and responsive</b>.`,
    `As I added more pages and projects, maintaining individual CSS styles for all the components became more challenging. 
    It looked messy and I was frequently repeating styling methods. 
    That's when I discovered <b>SASS</b>, which offered a <b>cleaner way to structure my CSS</b> with features like nesting, variables, and mixins. 
    Refactoring different parts of the site took some time, but through this process, I learned a lot about being detail-oriented and 
    refactoring one part at a time – skills that have been extremely useful in my previous programming jobs.`,
    `After my first co-op at Klue in Vancouver, I sharpened my <b>web development skills</b>, particularly in React and TypeScript. 
    When I updated my original portfolio website, I felt frustrated by the redundancies and saw a huge potential for improvement. 
    This inspired me to completely overhaul the site using <b>React (Next.js) and Tailwind CSS</b>. 
    These technologies allowed me to create reusable components, streamline the development process, 
    and <b>improve the site's performance and SEO</b> with Next.js's advanced features.`,
    `Switching to a JavaScript framework offered several advantages over plain HTML and CSS. 
    React's <b>component-based architecture</b> made my code more modular and easier to maintain. 
    Tailwind's utility-first CSS classes significantly reduced the amount of custom CSS I needed, ensuring a <b>consistent design system</b> across the site. 
    This combination allowed me to focus more on the functionality and aesthetics of my portfolio, 
    making it <b>cleaner, more scalable, and truly reflective</b> of my skills and personality.`,
    `The website is still a work in progress. So many new projects and designs to add but not enough time to add them. 
    But I find that every time I come back here, there's always something new to learn in website development. 
    And finding new opportunities for growth is always a fun time :)`,
    `And that concludes my work on my personal portfolio! I hope you enjoyed walking through my journey creating it, 
    because I put a lot of my heart and personality into the entire process. 
    This website is a manifestation of my dream to eventually grow into what the industry calls a 'unicorn developer' – 
    thriving at the intersection of both design and technology. 🦄`,
