  intro: `I'm <strong>Misha Reyes</strong>, a software engineer and experienced graphic designer. 
  I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Arts degree in Computer Science at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver. 
  I was born and raised in Manila, Philippines.`,
  aboutMeInfo: `One thing you could hear me talking non-stop about are all my <b>favorite TV shows</b>: Brooklyn Nine-Nine, Avatar: The Last Airbender, 
  Star Wars: Clone Wars, Adventure Time, Young Justice, The Good Place, How I Met Your Mother, Sherlock, Loki, Andor, and many, many more. At any given moment, I’m probably in the middle of 
  binging a brand new series or rewatching a classic. <br><br> While I watch my shows, I’m usually (sometimes even simultaneously :>) <b>designing or coding, or both</b>! These are the three things that I find I can do almost endlessly: 
  trying to puzzle through an episode’s cliffhanger, a design challenge, or yet another bug in my code. <br><br> In my spare time, I also love singing with my ukulele, scuba diving, badminton,
  teaching computer science as a <b>CPSC 213 TA at UBC</b>,  wakeboarding, cooking & eating Filipino food (ily Jollibee!), advocating for <b>gender equality in tech</b>, and learning about <b>UX/UI or blockchain</b>.`,
